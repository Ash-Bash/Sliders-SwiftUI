# Sliders

**Sliders** is a compilation of all my stylable drag based SwiftUI components. It provides a variety of unique controls as well as an enhanced version of the normal `Slider` called an `LSlider`. 
The various components are 
* `LSlider` - a spatially adaptive slider that fits to its container at any angle you decide.
* `RSlider` - A circularly shaped slider which restricts movement of the thumb to the radius of the circle 
* `OverflowSlider` - A meter like slider which has two moving components, the track and the thumb. Also has velocity based gestures implemented 
* `TrackPad` - A 2D version of a normal slider, which restricts displacement of the thumb to the bounds of the track 
* `RadialPad` - A joystick like component that does not reset the position of the thumb upon gesture end.
